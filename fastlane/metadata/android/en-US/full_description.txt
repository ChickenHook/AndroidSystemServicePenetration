BinderFuzzy is a fuzzer that can generate binder events in order to pentest system services running on the Android operating system (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Binder, https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/hidl/binder-ipc). You can validate if system services have correct error handling or transfer binder objects / tokens of other services in order to validate if the target system service validates binder arguments.

This Project covers following features:

* Browse managers and binder interfaces.
* Execute Fuzzy tasks
* Configure argument lists for each parameter of the method to fuzz
* Read logs of recent tasks
* Use python3 cli (optional) to execute fuzzer from desktop.
* Define fuzzer script and execute via cli
